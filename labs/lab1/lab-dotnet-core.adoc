= Lab 1 - Pushing a Ruby Application

== Target the Environment

. Follow the instructions to link:../README.adoc[Get Environment Access]

== Push It!

. Change to the _dotnet-core-cf-sample_app_ application directory:
+
----
$ cd $BOOTCAMP_HOME/dotnet-core-cf-sample-app
----

. Push the application!
+
----
$ cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

----
<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _scale-demo_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `devcloudwest.inbcu.com` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Notice that it's uploading _24 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack[.NET Core Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<7> Here we see the version of the Dotnet Core Framework that has been chosen and installed.
<8> And here we see our apps dependencies that have been discovered and installed.
<9> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html[Diego Cells]_ for execution.
<10> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<11> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:
+
image::lab-dotnet-core.png[]

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app <<app_name>>
----

. Change some data in the app
+
image::dotnet-core-change-data.png[]

. Restart the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf restart <<app_name>>
----

. Visit the app again.  Your changes were lost.  The app uses an in-memory database that gets destroyed and recreated every time the app is restarted.  Furthermore, if you run multiple instances of the app, each will have its own copy of the data.  In the next lab, we'll address this.
